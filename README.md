# OpioGene-DB
The project's objective is to streamline the management and interpretation of RNA-seq data obtained from placental cells, a pivotal process in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of placental function and response to external stimuli.

Its multifaceted interface encompasses distinct sections dedicated to metadata retrieval, count data examination, and the exploration of differentially expressed genes, with a particular focus on elucidating the impact of opioid drug consumption patterns across varying temporal contexts.

The databse proves as a helpful resource to help in learning more about the study about how the placenta works and its importance for human health. It gives researchers useful tools to come up with more ideas and explore data.
